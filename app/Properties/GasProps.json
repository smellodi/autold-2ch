* These are definitions of gas weights Wn used for computing their flow rates:
*
* Given the base flow rate BF and the mixture percentage for the first gas FGP,
* these flows are caluclated as follows:
*
*   gas1 flow rate = BF * W1 * FGP
*   gas2 flow rate = BF * W2 * (1 - FGP)
*
* So, if BF = 20 ml/min, the mixture was defined as Mix40, 
* the first gas is nButanol and its weight defined in this file is 1.0,
* the second gas is IPA and its weight defined in this file is 2.5,
* then the resulting flow to a participant will consist of two flows calculated as follow: 
*
*   nButanol flow rate = 20 * 1.0 * 0.40       =  8 ml/min
*   IPA flow rate      = 20 * 2.5 * (1 - 0.40) = 30 ml/min
